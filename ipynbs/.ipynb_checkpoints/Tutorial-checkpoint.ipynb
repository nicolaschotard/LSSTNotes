    "In this command line, you are asking to produce jobs with a name starting by \"$MYNAME-0013-PATTEST\", and using as inputs the files comming from the `plan_extract_star` production SNF-0013-CUBEFIT3e. It ends with a \"e\" as for `extract_star`, which is also the name of the ES mode in `batch_jobs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first test should crash since the first target from the list actually do not have any ES data from this production. To make it keep running, use the option \"--keep (-k)\":\n",
