-  This webpage is for now hosted on my computer !

-  If you want to make modifications, apply corrections, or improve this
   page, you can either work on one of the already existing ``Jupiter``
   notebook (you of course need it to be
   `installed <http://jupyter.org/>`__), which are stored under
   ``ipynbs``, or create a new one. Do not forget to add the notebook
   into the ``toctree`` of the ``doc/source/index.rst`` file.

-  When you are done with your modifications, build the html web page in
   the tree directory

   ::

       ./build_doc.sh

-  It will automatically convert all the notebooks into ``rst`` files
   and copy all the new figures that you could have added in the
   ``ipynbs/figures/`` directory to the right place.

-  Open the index.html in your browser, or reload, and make sure that
   everyting is the way it should be.
